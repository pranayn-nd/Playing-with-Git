1) instance member variable - variables declared inside a class. \\ other variables are local variables which we use in our daily life
2) instance member function - variables declared inside a class, \\ similarly functions
3) a method can be just declared and class and the definition can be both insided or outside
4) main thing to remember is 
   Object state should change only when its member functions are called
   To implement this we keep all the member variables as private by default
   member variables define the state of a class
5) Static Members in C++
     static local variables  -- initialised to 0 if not explicitly initialised
                             -- their lifetime is through out the program
     static member variables
     static function variables
