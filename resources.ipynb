    "\n",
    "Developers often need to find **real, high-quality code snippets** across multiple open-source repositories.\n",
    "Existing solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Copilot**: generates code but may not show tested examples or context.\n",
    "* **Sourcegraph / GitHub Search**: keyword-based, limited semantic understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Build a **developer-focused knowledge base** of real code, searchable by **natural language**, with **recommendations, explanations, and cross-language support**, acting like a “Google Scholar for code.”\n",
